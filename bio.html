            <h2>Thermochemistry in What We Ingest</h2>
            <div class="container1" style="margin:auto; width:80%; text-align:center">
                <p>Humans and all organisms eat food to gain the energy they need to survive, and the amount of energy in the food they consume is measured in calories. Calories are used to measure the amount of energy in food and can be determined by using thermochemistry. Using heat measurements, such as jules or calories, a student is able to find the amount of energy in a certain food, that an organism injests. This directly relates to health because an organism needs to consume a certain amount of energy to survive and properly thrive in their environment and by using thermochemisty students are able to determine the amount of energy they actually injest.</p>
                <p>That's where the calories from the labels on the back of all of the foods we eat come from! Humans need energy to function, and thus, thermochemistry also explains why we need to eat food.</p>

                <p>Note that the calories we see on the back of these foods is actually kilocalories!</p>

                <h3 style="font-size:1.4em">Thermochemistry in Drug Creation</h3>
                <p style="width:80%;margin:auto; text-align:center">Thermochemistry is used in the medical field through the creation of drugs. When creating new medication, experts have to use thermochemistry to determine how different chemicals will react with one another to create the proper combination to combat whatever the medication is for. Not only that, but scientists also need to know how the drug will react once actually taken by the human. </p>
                <br><br><p style="width:80%;margin:auto; text-align:center">Thermochemistry is also used in the way of Hessâ€™s Law. Scientists will use previous experiments preformed by other scientists to predict how certain chemicals will react with one another when creating a new form of medication. This allows scientists to make any necessary changes before actually creating the drug or before using it in lab testing.</p>
