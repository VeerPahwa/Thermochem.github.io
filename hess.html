            <h2>Hess' Law Lab</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;width:80%; margin:auto;margin-top:35px;margin-bottom:40px">In this experiment you will use a Styrofoam-cup calorimeter to measure the heat released by three reactions. The target reaction is the same as the combination of the other two reactions. Therefore, according to Hess’s law, the heat of the reaction of the target reaction should be equal to the sum of the heats of reaction for the other two. This concept is sometimes referred to as the additivity of heats of reaction. The primary objective of this experiment is to confirm this law.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;width:80%; margin:auto;margin-top:35px;margin-bottom:40px">Reactions used:<br><br>NaOH(s) → NaOh (aq)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp∆H1 &nbsp= ?<br>NaOH (s) + HCl(aq) → H2O(l) + NaCl(aq))&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp∆H2 = ?<br>NaOh(aq) + HCl (aq) → H20(l) + NaCl(aq)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp∆H3 = ?</p>
            <div class="container2"><h3 style="font-size:1.5em">Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combine equations from two reactions to obtain the equation for a third (target) reaction</li>
                    <li>Use a styrofoam cup calorimeter to measure the temperature and change it in each of three reactions.</li>
                    <li>Calculate the heat of reaction ∆Hrxn for the three reactions</li>
                    <li>Use the results to confirm Hess’s law</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 style="font-size:1.5em">Procedure</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Obtain and wear safety glasses</li>
                    <li>Place a styrofoam cup into a 250 mL beaker. Measure out 100.0 mL of distilled water into the Styrofoam cup. Lower the thermometer into the water.</li>
                    <li>Weight out 2 grams of solid sodium hydroxide, NaOH, and record the mass to the nearest 0.01 g. Caution: handle the NaOH and resulting solution with care.</li>
                    <li>After the temperature is constant, add the solid NaOH to the styrofoam cup and place a cover over the cup. Using the thermometer, stir continuously until the temperature reaches its maximum. As soon as the temperature has dropped to 1 C you may terminate the trial. Make sure to record Ti and Tf in your data table.</li>
                    <li>Rinse and dry the thermometer, styrofoam cup, and dispose of the solution as directed by your instructor.</li>
                    <li>For Reactions 2 use 100.0 mL of .50 M hydrochloric acid, HCL, instead of water</li>
                    <li>For Reaction 3 initially use 50.0 mL of 1.0 M HCL (instead of water) and pour it into the Styrofoam calorimeter. Also, instead of solid NaOH, measure 50,0 mL of 1.9 M NaOH solution into a graduated cylinder. After the  Ti has been determined from the 1.0 M HCL, add teh 1.9 M NaOH solution to the styrofoam cup. </li>
                </ol>

            <br><h3>Example Setup</h3><br>
            <img style="width:20%;margin-left:40%; border:3px solid black; border-radius:10px"src="https://education.mrsec.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/2017/08/image03polymer-225x300.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center;width:80%; margin:auto;margin-top:35px;margin-bottom:40px">Find the heat released (Q) by using q =mc∆T were c = 4.18 J/g°C</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;width:80%; margin:auto;margin-top:35px;margin-bottom:40px">∆H = -q, because the q we got is the heat absorbed by the solution, not the change in heat released through the reaction</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;width:80%; margin:auto;margin-top:35px;margin-bottom:40px">To find m, calculate the moles of NaOH used. Hint: For Rn. 3, use Molarity (M) = mol/L</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the law of conservation of energy and how heat flows between system and surroundings during both endothermic and exothermic processes.</li>
                    <li>Use the specific heat equation to perform calculations that relate mass, specific heat, change in temperature, and the amount of heat absorbed or released.</li>
                    <li>Define enthalpy, and know the conditions under which the enthalpy change in a reaction is equal to the heat absorbed or released.</li>
