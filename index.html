            <p style="margin:auto;text-align:center">This website teaches you the following concepts</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Describe the law of conservation of energy and how heat flows between system and surroundings during both endothermic and exothermic processes.</li>
                <li>Use the specific heat equation to perform calculations that relate mass, specific heat, change in temperature, and the amount of heat absorbed or released.</li>
                <li>Define enthalpy, and know the conditions under which the enthalpy change in a reaction is equal to the heat absorbed or released.</li>
                <li>Describe the principles behind calorimetry, and be able to calculate the heat absorbed or released during a process that occurs in a calorimeter.</li>
                <li>Write and solve problems with thermochemical equations.</li>
                <li>Describe the enthalpy change that occurs as a substance changes between the solid and liquid states.</li>
                <li>Describe the enthalpy change that occurs as a substance changes between the liquid and gas states.</li>
                <li>Calculate the enthalpy change involved in the change of state for any amount of a given substance.</li>
                <li>Calculate the enthalpy changes involved as substances dissolve in water.</li>
                <li>Use Hessâ€™s law of heat summation to add chemical reactions together in such a way as to produce a desired final equation. Calculate the enthalpy change for that final reaction.</li>
                <li>Define the standard heat of formation of a compound.</li>
                <li>Use known values for standard heats of formation to calculate a previously unknown standard heat of reaction.</li>
            </ul>
