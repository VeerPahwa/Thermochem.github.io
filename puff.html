                <h2>Cheese Puff Lab</h2>
                <p>In this lab, we are trying to figure out how much energy is in a bag of cheesepuffs!<br>A good setup is the following:</p>
                <img src="https://education.mrsec.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/2017/08/image02Calorimetry.png" alt="">
                <p>For something less accurate if you can't make the setup, you can just hold the burning cheesepuff under the cup of water</p>
                <div class="container2">
                    <h3>Procedure</h3>
                    <ol style="text-align:left">
                        <li>Make something akin to the setup above. At the bare-minimum, a non-flammable cup, 50mL of water, a thermometer, 3 cheesepuffs, and something to hold the cheesepuffs</li>
                        <li>Take rhe 3 cheesepuffs, one for each trial, and find their mass. This is to standardize results during the analysis</li>
                        <li>Place the thermometer in the cup of water and measure its initial temperature</li>
                        <li>Burn one cheesepuff under the glass of water. Measure the highest temperature that the water reaches</li>
                        <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4, 2 more times, for a total of 3 trials.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <h3 style="font-size:1.5em">Questions</h3>
                <p style="width:80%; margin:auto">Calculate the heat released by each cheese puff. Use Q = mcΔT to find q, where m is the mass of the water, ΔT is the change in temperature, and c = 4.184 (standard for water). At the end, make sure to divide by the mass of the cheesepuff to standardize your results to J/g.</p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <p style="width:80%; margin:auto">Find the average amount of heat energy per gram released by the cheesepuffs. Note that the q you solved for is the energy absorbed by the water, meaning the cheesepuff released that energy.</p>
                 <br><br><br><br>
                <p style="width:80%; margin:auto">Compare your answer with the nutrition facts on the back of the cheesepuff bag. Note that the number they give is in kilocalories, so you might have to do some dimensional analysis to see how close you were</p>
                <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <div class="container2"><h3 style="font-size:1.5em">Learning Objectives</h3>
                    <ul style="text-align:left">
                        <li>Describe the law of conservation of energy and how heat flows between system and surroundings during both endothermic and exothermic processes.</li>
                <li>Use the specific heat equation to perform calculations that relate mass, specific heat, change in temperature, and the amount of heat absorbed or released.</li>
                <li>Define enthalpy, and know the conditions under which the enthalpy change in a reaction is equal to the heat absorbed or released.</li>
                <li>Describe the principles behind calorimetry, and be able to calculate the heat absorbed or released during a process that occurs in a calorimeter.</li>
