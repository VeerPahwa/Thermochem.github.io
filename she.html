                <ul>
                    <li>Define enthalpy, and know the conditions under which the enthalpy change in a reaction is equal to the heat absorbed or released.</li>
                    <li>Describe the law of conservation of energy and how heat flows between system and surroundings during both endothermic and exothermic processes.</li>

            <h3 style="font-size:1.5em">Interesting Questions to Consider</h3>
            <ol style="width:80%;margin-left:10%">
                <li>What happens when the brick and iron block are stacked on a heater; what happens when they are stacked on the cooler? Why?</li>
                <li>Do the substances have a maxium amount of heat energy they can carry?</li>
                <li>Does the Iron or the Brick store heat energy faster? Which one releases energy faster? Why?</li>
                <li>To what point to the materials release the heat energy? Does all of the heat energy leave?</li>

                <h3 style="font-size:1.5em">Lab Explanation</h3>
                <div class="center">
                <p>In this lab different substances were either heated or cooled, and from this the user learned about how much energy (heat) certain substances can hold, and how heat is transformed in between substances. When any of the substance were put over heat, energy was given from the flame to the substance.</p>
                <p>Energy is shown to be given from the flame to the flame, showing a transfer of energy (heat), and when energy is released from a substance it shows the specific heat capacity of a substance, because when the substance has too much energy it is eventually released into itâ€™s surroundings.</p>
                <p>When layering the substance on top of one another the user is able to see energy being transferred from one substance to another, and something else the user notices is the energy is being transferred from the substance with more energy to the substance with less. The user now knows that energy (heat) moves from a substance with more energy (heat) to a substance with less energy (heat).
</p>
<p>Different energy sources release different kinds of energy, for example the person when exercising releases chemical energy from their body but it soons turns into mechanical energy when it goes through different devices that translate energy. When in the device the energy is to electrical energy and eventually moves that energy into the energy sources for different purposes. Once the energy reaches these objects the energy will eventually transform again, for example when the electric energy reaches the water it is converted into thermal energy. This entire process shows the ways in which energy can be converted into different substances and it changes based on the substance itself. Such as lights will have light energy and hot water will have thermal energy. Also during this whole process some of the heat will be released into the atmosphere.</p>
